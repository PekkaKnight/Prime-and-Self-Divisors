This is a project in C#. <br>
The user will input a number. <br>
##
This part checks if our number is a self-divisor or not. 
A Self Divisor is a number that divides into all of it's digits. <br>
So, since 128 is divisible by 8, 2, and 1, it returns **true**. 31 isn't a Self Divisor, since it does not divide into 3; **false** is returned. 
##
The next part is where we find the n numbers of consecutive self-divisors.<br>
For example, 11, 12, and 15 are the next 3 self divisors after 10, so they would be returned, if we asked for the first three self divisors after 10. 
##
The next part is to check if the number is prime or not. <br>
5 would return true, while 15 would return false. 
##
The final part of the projects returns the first n numbers of primes. <br>
So, let's say that our number is 30 and we asked for the first 3 prime numbers after 30.<br>
Our project returns 31, 37, and 41, since they are the first three prime numbers after 30.
